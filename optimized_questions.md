## Conversation Flow Strategy

### Opening Hook
"STOP. ðŸ›‘ Before you do anything else, I need you to know something that's going to change everything. In the next 5 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly why every diet you've ever tried has failed you. And then I'm going to give you the ONE thing that actually works. But here's the catch - I need you to be brutally honest with me. No BS. No 'I should' answers. Just the raw truth. Because here's what I know: You're tired of feeling like a failure. You're tired of starting over every Monday. You're tired of hating what you see in the mirror. And I'm about to fix ALL of that. Ready? Let's do this. ðŸ”¥"

### Transition Phrases
- "Perfect. Now I understand what's driving you."
- "I hear you. And here's what I want you to know - this is NOT your fault."
- "That's exactly why you're here. Because you're ready for something different."
- "I'm getting chills. I can literally see this happening for you."

### Closing
"Wow! ðŸ¤© I'm genuinely impressed by everything you've shared with me. You've been so open and honest, and I can already see the amazing potential here. Let me create your personalized nutrition profile based on everything you've told me. This is going to be powerful!"
