## Opening
"You've come here to get advice and make change. The best way to do that is to be honest with me.

## Gentle Warm-up Questions (Build Trust & Get Them Talking)

### 1. Discovery & Entry Point
**Q1:** "Tell me about how you found this app?"
- Data: How they discovered us, what drew them in

**Q2:** "Why did you want to use it?"
- Data: Initial motivation, what they're hoping for

### 2. Current State & Awareness
**Q3:** "Tell me about what you think needs to change?"

**Q4:** "And let's say you did make those changes for the next little while, what do you think is going to happen?"
- Data: Expectations, belief in change, motivation level

### 3. Vision & Dreams
**Q5:** "Ok now imagine in your wildest dreams what you would love to happen to your health, your fitness and your appearance?"
- Data: Ultimate vision, deepest desires

**Q6:** "If you have to choose between your health, fitness, strength or appearance which one would you choose?"
- Data: Priority hierarchy, what matters most

**Q7:** "What would you like to change most about your appearance?"
- Data: Specific appearance goals, body image concerns

### 4. Past Success & Comparison
**Q8:** "When was the fittest you've ever been?"

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. **Builds Trust Gradually**
- Starts with easy, non-threatening questions
- Gets them talking and comfortable
- Creates rapport before diving deep

### 2. **Creates Emotional Investment**
- Gets them thinking about their past success
- Builds excitement about their vision
- Creates contrast between then and now

### 3. **Reveals the Real Why**
- By the time we get to "how do you feel now?" they're emotionally invested
- The contrast between past and present creates urgency
- They're ready to be honest about what's really going on

### 4. **Natural Progression**
- Each question builds on the previous one
- Creates a story arc: discovery â†’ current state â†’ vision â†’ past success â†’ current reality
- Ends with the emotional impact of the gap
